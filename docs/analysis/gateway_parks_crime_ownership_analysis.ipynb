    "## Background: The Gateway Parks Crime Concern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Community Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Gateway Parks is a residential subdivision in Forney, Texas, developed in the mid-2000s. Like many suburban Dallas-Fort Worth communities, it has experienced demographic shifts as the area has grown rapidly. Recent years have seen increased investor activity in the housing market, with more properties purchased as rentals rather than primary residences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Crime Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Crime has drastically increased the last few years and this may be due to the amount of rental properties.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentiment has been echoed by community members and reported in local news:\n",
    "- **NBC DFW (Nov 2025):** \"Forney neighbors fight new development amid rise in crime,\" reporting that residents blame investor-owned homes for rising crime and that the city council denied a new phase by Ashton Woods.\n",
    "- **WFAA:** Residents claim crime is rising and point to rental properties, specifically mentioning issues on streets like **Lawnview Drive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crime Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the **Forney Police Department Transparency Portal** heat map (November-December 2025) and recent news reports:\n",
    "- Significant crime concentration (red/orange zones) appears in the **southeastern quadrant** of Gateway Parks.\n",
    "- Crime types include property crimes, disturbances, and other incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Reference:** See `docs/gateway_crime_heatmap.png` for Forney PD heat map  \n",

    "This analysis uses property appraisal data to \"tell the story\" of ownership in Gateway Parks and test the rental-crime hypothesis. We will:\n",
    "1. **Classify ownership** - Distinguish between homeowners, investors, and builder inventory.\n",
    "2. **Map ownership patterns** - Identify which streets are truly \"rental rows\".\n",
    "3. **Deep Dive into High-Crime Streets** - Specifically analyze Pueblo and the other problem streets.\n",
    "4. **Data-Driven Conclusion** - Determine if the data supports the community's fears.\n",

    "## Methodology: Ownership Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### How We Identify Owner-Occupied vs. Investor Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Owner-Occupied Properties:**\n",
    "- Mailing address city matches property city (both in Forney)\n",
    "- Assumption: Owner lives in the home they own\n",
    "- Typical homeowner who receives mail at their residence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Investor/Non-Owner Occupied Properties:**\n",
    "- Mailing address city differs from property city\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Owner lives in Dallas but owns rental in Forney\n",
    "  - Corporate/LLC ownership with business address elsewhere\n",
    "  - Out-of-state investors\n",
    "- Assumption: Property is a rental or investment, not owner's primary residence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Some owner-occupants may use P.O. boxes or business addresses\n",
    "- Some investors may use local addresses\n",
    "- This method provides a **reasonable approximation** for large-scale analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation:**\n",
    "- Gateway Parks properties analyzed: ~600+ homes\n",
    "- Manual spot-checking shows high accuracy for ownership classification\n",
    "- Consistent with national rental housing data (typically 30-40% in suburban areas)\n",

    "## Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Story of Gateway Parks: A Tale of Two Neighborhoods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis set out to test the community hypothesis: **\"Crime has drastically increased... due to the amount of rental properties.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data reveals a complex reality that partially supports but also complicates this narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The \"Rental\" Landscape is Significant:**\n",
    "    *   **31.6%** of Gateway Parks properties are non-owner occupied. This is a substantial portion of the community.\n",
    "    *   However, some \"high investor\" streets like **Bachman** and **Bushman** are actually dominated by **builders** (Ashton, K Hovnanian), representing new inventory rather than traditional rentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The \"High-Crime\" Streets are NOT All the Same:**\n",
    "    *   **Pueblo Drive** is the \"Smoking Gun\": With **76.5% investor ownership**, it is overwhelmingly non-owner occupied. If crime is high here, the correlation with rentals is strong.\n",
    "    *   **Lawnview & Everglades** are the \"Counter-Evidence\": Despite being identified as high-crime areas, they have **low investor rates** (significantly *below* the neighborhood average).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verdict on the Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is the rise in crime due to rental properties?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **For Pueblo Drive: ✅ YES (Likely Correlation).** The extreme concentration of investors (76.5%) coincides with high crime reports. This suggests a potential link between transient occupancy/absentee ownership and issues on this specific street.\n",
    "*   **For Lawnview & Everglades: ❌ NO (Unlikely Correlation).** These streets have high owner-occupancy. The crime issues here cannot be blamed on \"too many rentals.\" Other factors must be at play (e.g., location near entrances/exits, specific problem households, or spillover effects).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Targeted Intervention for Pueblo Drive:**\n",
    "    *   The HOA and City should focus rental registration and code enforcement efforts specifically on Pueblo Drive.\n",
    "    *   Engage with the major property owners (e.g., PRNL Residential Buyer LLC) to ensure tenant screening and property maintenance standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Investigate Non-Rental Factors for Lawnview/Everglades:**\n",
    "    *   Since rentals aren't the primary driver here, look for other causes:\n",
    "        *   **Traffic patterns:** Are these streets used as cut-throughs?\n",
    "        *   **Lighting/Visibility:** Is street lighting adequate?\n",
    "        *   **Specific Incidents:** Are the reports driven by domestic issues at a few specific owner-occupied homes rather than systemic rental issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Refine the \"Investor\" Definition:**\n",
    "    *   Future analysis should distinguish between **Institutional Investors** (LLCs owning many homes), **Small Landlords**, and **Builder Inventory**.\n",
    "    *   Builder-owned streets (Bachman, Bushman) should be monitored as they transition to occupied homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "Blaming \"rentals\" for all crime is an oversimplification. While **Pueblo Drive** serves as a cautionary tale of high investor concentration, **Lawnview and Everglades** prove that owner-occupied streets are not immune to crime. A successful safety strategy must address both rental management AND community-wide safety measures.\n",
